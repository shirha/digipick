Given an array of local disk filenames plus using something like "http-server" from node, could I load two canvases on page load? Here are fragments of some of the code.

const image_array = ["Screenshot (178).png", "Screenshot (179).png"];


<input type="file" id="imageInput" class="black-text" accept="image/*">
<canvas id="myCanvas" width="100" height="100"></canvas>
<canvas id="myCanvas2" width="100" height="100"></canvas>
...
const canvas = document.getElementById('myCanvas');
const context = canvas.getContext('2d');
const imageInput = document.getElementById('imageInput');
...
imageInput.addEventListener('change', function (event) {
  const file = event.target.files[0];
  if (file) {
    const reader = new FileReader();
    reader.onload = function(e) {
      const img = new Image();
      img.onload = function() {
        // Clear the canvas
        context.clearRect(0, 0, canvas.width, canvas.height);
        
        // Draw the image onto the canvas
        context.drawImage(img, 0, 0, canvas.width, canvas.height);

        imageInput.classList.add('yellow-text');
        document.getElementById('warning').style.display = 'none';
        drawCircles();

      };
      img.src = e.target.result;
    };
    reader.readAsDataURL(file);
  }
});

Yes, you can load multiple canvases on page load and populate them with images from an array of local disk filenames or URLs using JavaScript. You can use a loop to create canvases and load images into them. Here's an example of how you can do it:

HTML:

html
Copy code
<!-- Add canvas elements to your HTML with unique IDs -->
<canvas id="myCanvas1" width="100" height="100"></canvas>
<canvas id="myCanvas2" width="100" height="100"></canvas>
<!-- Add more canvas elements as needed -->

<script src="your-script.js"></script>
JavaScript (your-script.js):

javascript
Copy code
const canvasCount = 2; // Adjust this to match the number of canvases you want

// Array of local disk filenames or URLs
const imageArray = ["Screenshot (178).png", "Screenshot (179).png"];

// Load images into canvases on page load
window.addEventListener('load', () => {
  for (let i = 0; i < canvasCount; i++) {
    const canvasId = `myCanvas${i + 1}`; // Assuming canvas IDs are "myCanvas1", "myCanvas2", ...
    const canvas = document.getElementById(canvasId);
    const context = canvas.getContext('2d');

    // Check if the corresponding image exists in the array
    if (i < imageArray.length) {
      const img = new Image();
      img.onload = function () {
        // Clear the canvas
        context.clearRect(0, 0, canvas.width, canvas.height);

        // Draw the image onto the canvas
        context.drawImage(img, 0, 0, canvas.width, canvas.height);

        // Call any additional functions or operations here
        // For example, you can call drawCircles() if needed
        // drawCircles();
      };
      img.src = imageArray[i];
    }
  }
});

In this code:

You first add the canvas elements to your HTML with unique IDs (e.g., "myCanvas1", "myCanvas2", etc.).

In your JavaScript file (your-script.js), you specify the number of canvases you want (canvasCount) and the array of local disk filenames or URLs (imageArray).

You use window.addEventListener('load', ...) to ensure that the code runs when the page has fully loaded.

Inside the event listener, you loop through the canvases using their IDs, and for each canvas, you check if the corresponding image exists in the imageArray. If an image is available, you load it into the canvas.

You can call additional functions or perform other operations as needed, such as drawCircles().

This code will load images into the canvases on page load, and you can extend it to include more canvases and images as required.

please help me understand this code. Does this statement actually cause the canvas to be loaded?

      img.src = imageArray[i];

Yes, the statement img.src = imageArray[i]; assigns the source URL or file path from the imageArray to the img variable, which effectively loads the image into memory and begins the process of fetching the image from the specified source. This statement triggers the loading process of the image, but it doesn't directly render or display the image on the canvas at that moment.

Here's what happens when you execute img.src = imageArray[i];:

The browser initiates an HTTP request to retrieve the image file specified by imageArray[i]. If it's a local file, it's loaded from the local file system. If it's a URL, it's fetched from the web.

While the image is being fetched, the rest of the JavaScript code continues to execute. The onload event handler is set to execute a function when the image has finished loading.

Once the image has been successfully fetched and loaded into memory, the onload event handler function specified with img.onload is called.

Inside the onload event handler function, you can perform actions with the loaded image, such as drawing it onto a canvas (in this case, clearing the canvas and using context.drawImage() to draw the image onto the canvas).

So, the statement img.src = imageArray[i]; is the starting point for loading the image, and the actual rendering of the image onto the canvas happens in the onload event handler function, which ensures that the image is fully loaded and ready for use.
